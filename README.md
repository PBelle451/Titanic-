One of the earliest Machine Learning projects I finished. This project uses the Logistic Regression algorithm and it calculates what is the probabilty of surviving the Titanic using logistic regression and using the number of people who survived (or didn't) as the dependent variable and name, sex, class, age and Id as the independent variables.
